    <h3>Chicken strips with the ranch build in!</h3>
    <p>Simple to make. Kids will love them! 
        They can even help with the cooking. 
        You can still dip them, if that's what you want, but they are also wonderful by themselves.
    </p>
    <p>Another pro to this recipe, since they are baked 
        you can actually make these and, for the most part, 
        let the oven do a majority of the cooking for you!
